Project:PASSWORD STRENGTH CHECKER


OBJECTIVE OF TH PROJECT:
----------------------------------------------------
The objective of this project is to develop a tool that evaluates the strength of passwords entered by users based on multiple security criteria. The tool aims to:

Enhance password security by analyzing the complexity, length, and uniqueness of user-provided passwords.
Provide real-time feedback to users, suggesting improvements where necessary to ensure stronger, more secure passwords.
Reduce vulnerability risks by encouraging users to create passwords that are resistant to common attacks, such as brute force, dictionary, and pattern-based attacks.
Implement algorithms that assess critical factors, including:
Minimum password length.
Use of both uppercase and lowercase characters.
Inclusion of numbers and special characters.
Avoidance of repeated sequences or common patterns.
Increase awareness about good password practices by offering suggestions and feedback to users when weak or commonly used passwords are detected
